BACKGROUND
########################################

I am collecting feedback for my webapp, pucklab.

Pucklab is a webapp that graphically summarizes a
hockey game based on play by play data.

I do not yet have the webserver set up, so you
are testing a static and standalone version of
the app. Basically one game. That shows the Oilers
loosing.

QUESTIONS

1. Did the app seem to work? You could see a bar graphs describing
the game stats and a plot to describe the game flow. (Yes or No)?

2. Did you encounter any bugs? If yes, please describe.

3. Did you encounter any problems with the data?
EI, data seemed to be missing.

4. Can you understand what the graphs show?

5. What features would you like to see added?

6. What did you like about the app?

Thank you for your time.
