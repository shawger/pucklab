BACKGROUND
########################################

I am collecting feedback for my webapp, pucklab.

Pucklab is a webapp that graphically summarizes a
hockey game based on play by play data.

I do not yet have the webserver set up, so you
are testing a static and standalone version of
the app. Basically one game. That shows the Oilers
loosing.

QUESTIONS
########################################

1. Did the app seem to work? You could see a bar graphs describing
the game stats and a plot to describe the game flow. (Yes or No)? Yes

2. Did you encounter any bugs? No

3. Did you encounter any problems with the data?
No. But I am not sure what I am looking at.

4. Can you understand what the graphs show? Not really. If I knew hockey than maybe.

5. What features would you like to see added? A better description of what the graphs are supposed to be.

6. What did you like about the app? Colors look nice. The zooming feature.  

Thank you for your time.
